                        <p>Liquid waste often contains fats, oils, grease, dirt, sludge, and gases. When discharged directly into a water body, it makes the water highly contaminated and unusable in any form due to high toxicity levels, pH imbalance, threat of harmful bacteria and high COD and BOD levels. It also causes foul odour to spread in surrounding areas. </p>

Our process is what sets us apart from the others. Whatever the form or intensity of your liquid waste, we first assess it in depth, understand your space and financial constraints and then recommend a solution that solves your problem completely without hurting your premises or your budget. </p>
                        <p>We can set up a fully functional treatment plan from scratch, and we can also revive your existing but dysfunctional plant. Our solutions neutralize the contamination and make the water reusable. Upon application, it arrests foul odour instantly and brings the pH, COD and BOD levels within desired limits. The solution can also be used directly to treat contamination in any kind of water body like lakes, ponds, wells, canals, and public drainage.</p>

Be it a household site, industrial site or a dumping yard, this process is followed diligently to install a customized waste processing and composting system. </p>
                        <p>The composting system is driven by our eco-friendly products which have an instant impact on solid bio waste. Foul odour gets eliminated within minutes and the decomposition process is hastened from 90 days to a mere 30 days. The quality of compost formed is also of the highest quality. </p>

                        <p>All types of sewage treatment plants - be it ASP, MBBR, SBR or MBR - deal with a number of challenges. The biggest challenge is improper and inefficient treatment of the sewage. This leads to filters getting choked very often, greenhouse gas emission, bad odour in the surroundings and thick sludge formation. Thick sludge formation that necessitates frequent maintenance, membranes and filters that need to be replaced often and constant use of blowers. All this increases the cost of operation by a significant amount on a regular basis. </p>

                            <p>For new STPs, we first evaluate the affluent characteristics, waste generation volumes and the space available at client premises. Based on these, we plan, design, and implement a fully functional treatment plant supplemented with our nature-friendly solutions to ensure high efficiency and safe output water that can be discharged safely or used for irrigation without any concerns. For defunct or improperly functioning STPs, we assess the problems in detail and then design an effective solution which is a precise combination of our various eco-friendly  products.</p>
                            <p>With our solution, we ensure reduced sludge formation and the odour-less bio-sludge gets easily degraded with soil. The treated water can be safely used for gardening or released into the ecosystem. It also eliminates the need for any of the other harmful chemicals and is extremely simple and easy to use. It. Due to 65% shorter treatment time, the STP can be operated above and beyond the design capacity if needed.</p>

Based on the characteristics and intensity of the effluents, the accurate treatment process and dosage are recommended by our team of experts.

                        <p>With increasing population density and industrialization, our water bodies and ground water have been the most affected. Due to improperly treated sewage and ill-designed waste management systems, the water supply that reaches our homes is often highly contaminated.</p>
                        <p>The most common treatment for drinking water involves Chlorine, which has two major drawbacks. Strong odour, residues in the water and change of taste. Despite all kinds of measures, these issues with purifying drinking water still remain.</p>

                    <div class="cont pt-3">
                        <h3>Our Solution</h3>
                        <p>These problems inspired our team to do deep research and develop a solution that will filter and purify the water coming to our homes. The water is first tested and depending on the analysis, the appropriate solution is designed and implemented. For minor impurities, a simple WTP (filtration) would suffice. But for higher contamination, we might have to opt for RO/ UF/ UV processes to be installed. The solution is decided based on the test report of the water, and it can be tailored for small residences as well as large industrial installations.
